## Installation

1. Tap the mounting brackets using an M2 tap. I predrilled these with a 1.5mm drill just to clean out the holes.
2. Install FlyFishRC M10 Mini GPS Module and hold in place with some hot glue (might add a M2 bolted bracket for this at a later date). There are instructions for wiring this on youtube. Just a warning note, the original wire harness that comes with the GPS melted from touching the VTX. I replaced it with some better silicone wire to prevent future shorts. Be careful.
3. I replaced the bolts connecting the frame to the shroud with M2 12MM bolts and added a M2 nylon locking nut, and washer before the grommet. This prevented the bolt from coming undone due to vibrations.
